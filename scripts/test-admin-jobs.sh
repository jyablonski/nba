# Exercises the real runner against the real Postgres in the local Compose
# project. Not a unit test: the runner is shell + SQL, and the parts that are
# easy to get wrong (atomic claim, flock contention, reaping an abandoned job)
# only exist when a database and a lock file do.
#
#   make test-admin-jobs      # needs `make up` / a running postgres
#
# Uses its own LOCK_FILE so it can never collide with a real refresh, and
# restores source.admin_jobs to empty on exit.
