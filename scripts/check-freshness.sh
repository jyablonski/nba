#
# Deliberately independent of the refresh path. Every other signal in this
# system is emitted *by* the pipeline: Slack posts come from SyncAlert, and
# source.pipeline_runs rows are written by the scraper. A pipeline that never
# starts is therefore completely silent — which is exactly what happened when
# cron ran `make refresh-daily` instead of `make prod-refresh` and died at the
# Alembic step before the scraper ever opened a session.
#
# This needs only a running postgres and curl, so it survives the failure modes
# that break the refresh (wrong make target, missing IMAGE_PREFIX, unpullable
# or unbuildable tools image). Run it from a SEPARATE cron entry, hours after
# the refresh window:
#
#   45 11 * * * cd /opt/nba && ./scripts/check-freshness.sh >> /opt/nba/logs/freshness.log 2>&1
#
# Exit 0 = healthy or intentionally disabled. Exit 1 = stale (alert posted).
