# admin-job-runner.sh — claim and execute one queued job from source.admin_jobs.
#
# The /admin console enqueues; this runs. It has to live on the host because
# executing `make` means talking to the Docker socket, and the API container
# must never be given one: it is reachable from the internet through Caddy, so
# docker.sock there would be root-equivalent on the box.
#
# Runs one job per invocation and exits, so a stuck job cannot wedge a loop.
# Wire it to cron (or a systemd timer) every minute:
#
#   * * * * * cd /opt/nba && make prod-admin-jobs >> /opt/nba/logs/admin-jobs.log 2>&1
#
# Shares LOCK_FILE with the daily refresh so an operator button press can never
# overlap the 08:15 cron. If the lock is held the job goes back to 'queued' and
# is retried on the next tick rather than being reported as a failure.

# never claims one, so the console wedges permanently and the only way out is
# the SSH session this whole feature exists to avoid.

# Two conditions, both required. The flock being free is the real signal that
# no job is actually executing; the age grace covers the microsecond gap
