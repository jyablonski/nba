# Baseline

Baseline is a full stack NBA analytics platform, from data collection and a Postgres warehouse to predictive modeling, APIs, and a Next.js web app. Explore players, teams, standings, schedules, game flow, and player comparisons.

## Architecture

The main data flow collects NBA data, transforms it into analytics tables, and serves it to the web app and AI tools.

```mermaid

  Sources["Basketball-Reference<br/>Optional: Odds API · Reddit"] --> Scraper["Scraper"]

  subgraph Postgres["Postgres"]
    Source[("source<br/>Raw data")]

    subgraph dbt["dbt"]
      Silver[("silver<br/>Staging and intermediate")]
      Gold[("gold<br/>Analytics tables")]
    end

    Source --> Silver
    Silver --> Gold
  end

  Scraper --> Source
  Gold --> API["FastAPI<br/>REST API"]
  API --> Frontend["Baseline<br/>Next.js web app"]
  Gold --> Cube["Cube<br/>Semantic Layer"]
  Cube -->|Ask results| API
  Cube --> MCP["MCP<br/>Tools for AI assistants"]
```

Postgres holds three schemas: `source` for ingested data, `silver` for cleaned intermediate models, and `gold` for analytics tables consumed by the API, Cube, and ML jobs. The web app talks to FastAPI; Ask and MCP use Cube to query the warehouse.

## Services

| Service             | Role                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `services/scraper`  | Collects NBA stats, schedules, play-by-play, contracts, and injuries, plus optional odds and Reddit data, into Postgres.   |
| `services/migrate`  | Uses Alembic to create and update the `source` database tables.                                                            |
| `services/dbt`      | Cleans and joins source data into `silver` models and `gold` analytics tables.                                             |
| `services/ml`       | Generates pregame win probabilities with Elo ratings and writes predictions back to `source` for dbt to publish to `gold`. |
| `services/api`      | Serves analytics through FastAPI REST endpoints and routes Ask questions through Cube.                                     |
| `services/frontend` | Provides the Baseline web app with Next.js, including browsing, charts, comparisons, and an Ask page.                      |
| `services/cube`     | Defines shared metrics and queryable datasets over `gold` for Ask and MCP.                                                 |
| `services/mcp`      | Exposes Cube queries as FastMCP tools for AI assistants.                                                                   |
