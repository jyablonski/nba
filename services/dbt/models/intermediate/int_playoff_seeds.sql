-- Final playoff seeding, which is not the same thing as the standings.
-- Regular-season standings rank by record; the play-in tournament then decides
-- seeds 7-10, so a team can finish ahead of a better record (POR 42-40 seeded
-- 7th over PHX 45-37 in 2025-26).
--
-- Bracket, per conference:
--   A: record 7 vs record 8   -> winner takes seed 7, loser drops to game C
--   B: record 9 vs record 10  -> loser is eliminated and holds seed 10
--   C: loser(A) vs winner(B)  -> winner takes seed 8, loser holds seed 9
-- Seeds 1-6 are locked on record. Nothing is emitted for a conference until all
-- three of its play-in games are final, so a mid-season run yields no seeds.
