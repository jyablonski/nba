-- Basketball-Reference leaves action_type / sub_type null on every row, so the
-- event vocabulary only exists in the free-text description. This model turns
-- that text into typed columns (shots with distance, typed fouls and turnovers,
-- rebounds, free throws, substitutions, challenges) so downstream marts can
-- aggregate events without re-deriving the regexes. It carries the raw action
-- columns through as well, so fct_play_by_play can be a single wide mart
-- instead of a thin sibling pair over the same 632k-row grain.
--
-- Incremental because this is by far the most expensive model in the project:
-- ~30 regex operations per row over the full play_by_play history. Rebuilding
-- every row nightly to add one evening's games cost ~132s; scoping it to newly
-- scraped games makes the daily pass proportional to the slate. Logic changes
-- here need `dbt build --select int_play_by_play_events+ --full-refresh`.
