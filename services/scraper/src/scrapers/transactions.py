"""Scrape the Basketball-Reference season transactions log into source.

Grain is one row per transaction, keyed by sha256(date|description) — see
``transactions_parse.transaction_key``. Participants are a child table because
a single trade names several players and teams.

Be polite: BRef rate-limits aggressively. Runs whenever the pipeline is
``enabled`` — not behind ``season_active``, because free agency, buyouts, and
summer trades all land while the season gate is shut.
