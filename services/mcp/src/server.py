These questions use named Cube tools or query_cube (Cube query JSON only):

1. **Back-to-back analysis**: "How does Kawhi Leonard perform on back-to-backs?"
   → Use get_player_back_to_backs(player_id, season)

2. **Player comparison**: "Who has more career games, LeBron or Curry?"
   → Use compare_players([player_uuid_a, player_uuid_b], stats=["games"])

3. **Team record by city**: "What is the Warriors' win percentage in Chicago?"
   → Use get_team_record("GSW", arena_city="Chicago")

4. **Game log**: "Show me LeBron's last 10 games"
   → Use get_player_game_log(player_uuid)

5. **Career stats**: "What are Stephen Curry's career averages?"
   → Use get_career_stats(player_uuid)

6. **Ad-hoc Cube query**: "Which team has the most wins this season?"
   → Use query_cube with measures/dimensions from nba://schema (not SQL)

7. **Salary**: "What is Curry's salary?"
   → Use get_player_contract(player_uuid)

8. **Payroll**: "What is the Warriors payroll?"
   → Use get_team_payroll("GSW")

9. **Standings**: "Who leads the West?" / "How many games back are the Lakers?"
   → Use get_standings(conference="West")

10. **Season averages**: "Curry PPG by season"
   → Use get_player_season_stats(player_uuid)

11. **Schedule / Elo WP / injuries / odds / PBP / reddit**: named tools or query_cube
