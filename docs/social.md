# Social (Social)

r/nba posts and their top comments, modelled into discourse metrics. Supersedes the API and enrichment sections of [plans/social-tab.md](plans/social-tab.md): the route is `/api/v1/social`, not `/api/v1/social`, and entity links live in their own fact rather than widening `fct_reddit_posts`.

**Current:** ingest, dbt models, Cube, REST. **Not built:** the frontend page, and any score history.

## Ingest

`services/scraper/src/scrapers/reddit.py` — hot + top of day from r/nba, plus the **top 10 comments per post**. Runs whenever the pipeline is enabled, not behind `season_active`. Upserts on `reddit_id` and overwrites every other column, so **score and `num_comments` are the latest snapshot, not a series** — velocity and "trending" are not derivable. Roughly 40 posts and 400 comments a day.

## Warehouse

| Layer  | Relation                                   | Grain                                                   |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| gold   | `fct_reddit_posts` / `fct_reddit_comments` | one post / one comment (thin copies)                    |
| silver | `int_reddit_documents`                     | one document: a post's title + selftext, or one comment |
| gold   | `fct_reddit_entity_mentions`               | one entity per document                                 |
| gold   | `fct_reddit_flair`                         | one distinct user-flair string, resolved to a franchise |
| seed   | `nba_team_aliases`                         | one team shorthand (`cavs`, `clips`, `sixers`, …)       |
| seed   | `nba_reddit_flair_codes`                   | one r/nba flair emoji code                              |

`int_reddit_documents` normalizes text with the existing `normalize_player_name` macro and pads it with spaces, so matching is a whole-token substring test. `[removed]` and `[deleted]` bodies are dropped.

### Entity matching precision

**Players match on full name only.** A single-token rule was tested against the live corpus and was roughly half wrong: "Michael Jordan drops 45" matched DeAndre Jordan, "Kobe Bryant" matched Thomas Bryant, "Russell Westbrook" matched D'Angelo Russell. Gating on surname uniqueness does not fix it, because `dim_players` holds only current players — it cannot rule out a collision with someone it does not contain.

The cost is recall: `kawhi` appears in ~31 documents where `Kawhi Leonard` appears in 8. **Surname- and nickname-only references are not counted, and the UI has to say so.** Teams have no such problem and match on full name, nickname, or alias.

### Flair

Two different fields. `flair` is the post's own `link_flair_text` — a content tag, null on ~90% of posts, and useless as a team signal. `author_flair` is the **user's team badge**, present on about half of posts and two thirds of comments, and is what `fct_reddit_flair` resolves.

Four resolution paths: an emoji code with a numeric variant (`:lal-1: Lakers`), an emoji code without one, a bracketed abbreviation (`[SAS] Tim Duncan`), and a plain nickname (`Lakers`). **The numeric variant is what makes a code a team badge** — `:phi:` is Philippines while `:phi-1:`…`:phi-5:` are the 76ers, and that suffix is the only thing separating them. Reddit's code is not always the NBA abbreviation: Milwaukee is `mke`, New Orleans is `nol`, and `tbr` is the 2020-21 Tampa Bay Raptors. Historic labels ride current codes, so `:was-5: Washington Bullets` is a Wizards fan; `sea` (Supersonics) has no current franchise and stays `other`.

`flair_scope` is `team`, `league`, or `other`; `flair_team_id` is set only for `team`. **Not backfillable** — Reddit returns the author's _current_ flair, so rows stored before this shipped stay null unless that post is re-scraped.

## Derived metrics

Defined in `services/api/src/queries/social.py`.

- **`discussion_ratio`** — `num_comments / greatest(score, 1)`. The score floor is deliberate: this is the feed's sort key, and nulling it at score 0 would drop exactly the contested posts it exists to surface.
- **`top_comment_leverage`**, **`comment_concentration`** — top / summed captured comment score over post score, using `nullif(score, 0)`. These compare a score to a score, so a zero denominator is meaningless rather than floored, and they come back null.
- **`is_contested`** — `score <= 25 AND num_comments >= 50`. Reddit reports a floor: across the first 169 posts there were 23 at exactly 0, no negatives, and 21 of those 23 were over a day old when scraped. **0 is not a score waiting to be revealed.** Only 9 posts fell between 1 and 25, so the comment floor does most of the filtering.
- **`content_type`** — `highlight` / `report` / `discussion` / `link`, from the leading title bracket. `flair` is null on ~86% of posts; the bracket (`[Highlight]`, `[Charania]`, `[PTFO]`) is the real taxonomy.
- **`source`** — link host, with self-posts collapsed to `self`.

**No Controversy Index.** Inside the contested set the distinct scores are `[0, 1, 8, 18]`, so any log-scaled formula either ties every score-0 post at the maximum or reorders on vote-fuzz noise. Rank that table by comment count until in-season data spreads the scores out.

## REST

All under `/api/v1/social`, gold-only, no Cube. Every list takes `from_date` / `to_date` (inclusive) and `subreddit`.

`num_comments` is the real Reddit total and `captured_comment_count` is at most 10. **Any UI showing a comment list must label it as a sample.**

## Refresh stamp

`source.scrape_pipeline.daily_refresh_utc` (TIME, nullable) is **hand-maintained** — nothing writes it, and editing the host crontab does not update it. `GET /api/v1/status` rolls it forward to the next occurrence as `next_scrape_at`, or returns null when unset. A non-daily schedule would need a cron expression and a parser instead.

```sql
UPDATE source.scrape_pipeline SET daily_refresh_utc = '06:00' WHERE id = 1;
```
